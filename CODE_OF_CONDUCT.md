# Code of Conduct

## Be respectful. Be constructive. Don’t be an asshole.

Qlue-ls is an open source project.  
Participation is a privilege, not a right.

If you interact here — through issues, pull requests, discussions, or other community spaces — you are expected to behave like a professional adult.

### What that means

- Be respectful, even when you disagree.
- Criticize ideas, not people.
- Give constructive feedback.
- Assume good intent.
- Help improve the project rather than attack others.

### What is not acceptable

- Harassment, discrimination, or hate speech
- Personal attacks or insults
- Trolling or intentionally inflammatory behavior
- Sexualized language or unwanted advances
- Publishing private information without permission
- Repeatedly derailing discussions

If you’re unsure whether something crosses the line — it probably does.

## Enforcement

This project is maintained by its owner.

Unacceptable behavior may result in:

- Comment or content removal
- Locked threads
- Rejected contributions
- Temporary or permanent bans

Severe cases may result in immediate removal from the community without warning.

## Scope

This applies to all project spaces, including:

- GitHub issues
- Pull requests
- Discussions
- Project-related communication channels

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, contact the maintainer directly via GitHub.

Reports will be handled privately and in good faith.

## Final Note

Open source works best when people treat each other with basic decency.

If you can’t do that, this is not the project for you.
